Original code from JeeLabs http://news.jeelabs.org/code/

forked by Adafruit

and then forked by me... rlameiro :D

Now forked, enhanced, and mutilated by me xxxajk.


What's new:

* Preliminary Teensy 3.0 RTC support. Please test!

* AVR:
  All the standard libc time functions are available.
  Epoch is 1/1/1900.
  time_t is an int64_t and does not have the January 19, 2038 overflow problem.
  I2C is protected by xmem's multitasking lock if you use multitasking.
  If you are missing the DS1307 chip, the library automatically reverts to
  using the software millis RTC which is only good for ~49 days.

* You no longer have to 'start' RTC with begin.

* You do not have to declare that you use any particular RTC.

* There are 3 simplified functions for using the entire RTC library.
        Set the time
                RTCset(const DateTime& dt);
        Get the current time
                DateTime RTCnow();
        Find out if RTC is hardware.
                boolean RTChardware(void);

* DS1307 specifics:
  Read and write to DS1307 scratch memory is available, as is the
  SqwPinMode setting.

TO-DO:
       Make a unified access method to RTC specific features, such as:
         * Access to RTC memory
         * Access to RTC PIN features

Notes for DS1307 users in the far future:
  In the year 2100 you will have to get a new DS1307 and adjust the software,
  because the DS1307 is only good to the year 2099. :-)

Notes for Teensy 3.0 users on and after January 19, 2038:
  time_t in the libc is only 32 bits.
  The date restarts at December 13, 1901 due to an overflow.
  Please complain to GNU and the developers of libc about it.
